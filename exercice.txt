	Get back to our online books website.

	You should improve your project using Migration & Eloquent model

	- Step 1 :

		Create a migration to create the table 'books'.
		Do not forget any fields.

	- Step 2 :

		Create seeds for this table.
		You should have 10 fake books.

	- Step 3 :

		Create the model 'Book'.
		This model will be use to handle book in our application and save or edit them in databases.
		For now, it should be empty

	- Step 4 :

		Now, you will edit your controller !
		The controller should ask the model for datas that he needs.
		He can eventually do some validations (basic validations OR you can check Laravel Validations).
		And then it will call the view.

	- Step 5 :

		If you didn't do the Step 3 of previous exercise, you will have to do this now.

		You will have to change the operations for Inserting and Updating.
		You should now do an ajax call when clicking on the submit button.
		It should display a message.
		You should handle errors in the form and do validations.
